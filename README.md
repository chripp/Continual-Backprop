# Continual-Backprop
Implementations and experiments for Continual Backprop (CBP) and Continual PPO (CPPO).

Currently:
- Adam implementation that allows for resetting individual weights' 'step' counter
- Jupyter notebook for trial and error experiments
- Pre-calculated 1M steps of bitflip environment data for easier validation of changed algorithms
